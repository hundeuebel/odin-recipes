    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This basic chocolate cake recipe can be combined with any frosting, topping or mix ins you like, but it also tastes just as good plain. The recipe makes a large cake, enough to feed at least 8 "fed but ready for dessert" people. Or one "made this cake for myself because I am trying to fill the gaping hole in my heart" person. I don't judge!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup dark cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup cooled strong coffee (or water)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9x13 pan with nonstick baking spray.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugars and beat again.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time and beat until mixed in. Stir in the vanilla.</li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir together the milk and coffee.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk mixture to the butter mixture. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then flip out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
